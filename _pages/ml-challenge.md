This year's challenge focuses on training models to predict gain profiles for **Commercial Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs)**. EDFAs are critical components in optical communication systems, and accurate gain profile prediction is essential for optimizing network performance and reliability.

## Why This Matters

EDFA gain profile prediction is crucial for:
- Network planning and optimization
- Dynamic power management
- System reliability and performance monitoring
- Cost-effective network operations





- [COSMOS EDFA Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/functions-lab/COSMOS-EDFA-Dataset)

## Challenge Details

- **Objective**: Develop Theoretical, analytical or ML models that can accurately predict the gain profile of commercial EDFAs under various operating conditions
- **Dataset**: Real-world EDFA data collected from commercial systems
- **Evaluation**: Models will be scored based on prediction accuracy under different operating condition and aspects
- **Prize**: The highest-scoring model will receive an invitated submission to **IEEE/Optica Journal of Lightwave Technology(JLT)**

## Important Dates

- **Competition launch with dataset and instructions release**: Sept. 15, 2025
- **Submission deadline**: Dec. 15, 2025
- **Finalists announced**: Jan. 15, 2026
- **Live competition and winners announced**: During OFC 2026 (Mar. 15–19)

## Prizes

- **Invited papers** from the ML Challenge winner(s) to the IEEE/Optica JLT or JOCN Special Issue on “The 1st OFC 2026 ML Challenge”
- A **dedicated repository** for hosting all the ML Challenge results and the leaderboard
- An **award ceremony** will be held for the ML Challenge winning teams, with recognition (e.g., plaques) and prizes (e.g., GPUs supported by IEEE/Optica or Industry)

## Materials

In **Phase 1** (prior to OFC), we invite ML Challenge submissions using the existing public COSMOS and OpenIreland datasets ([GitHub link]). The submissions will be evaluated by a dedicated committee and student volunteers, who must declare any conflict of interest (COI) with competing teams, based on the following criteria:

- **Innovation**: Novel approaches and techniques used in developing the ML models;
- **Accuracy**: Average accuracy and tail accuracy of the developed ML models;
- **Efficiency**: Computational and training efficiency of the proposed solutions, and the amount of training data required to achieve the target accuracy performance.
