This year's challenge focuses on training models to predict gain profiles for **Commercial Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs)**. EDFAs are critical components in optical communication systems, and accurate gain profile prediction is essential for optimizing network performance and reliability, especially under dynamic channel loading conditions.

## Motivation

EDFA gain profile prediction is crucial for:
- Network planning and optimization
- Dynamic power management
- System reliability and performance monitoring
- Cost-effective network operations

Especially under dynamic channel loading conditions. Recently, researchers acheives high accuracy over gain profile predictions, but there are still some challenge unsolved. In our testing, we will evaluate the following three aspects of your EDFA gain profile model: 
- EDFA gain profile aging effect
- Spectrum hole burning effect under dynamic channel loading 
- Unseen gain and tilt settings of EDFA

## Challenge Details

- **Objective**: Develop Theoretical, analytical or ML models that can accurately predict the gain profile of commercial EDFAs under various operating conditions
- **Dataset**: We will provide a large EDFA gain profile dataset which is collected three years ago, and a small amount of the EDFA measurements we collect recently aiming the three technique issue we mentioned above. 
- **Evaluation**: Models will be scored based on prediction accuracy under an hidden testset with three aspects mentioned above.

## Dataset repo 
- We will provide all the codes for pre-processing the measurements data and a simple ML-based model just for reference
- Please refer to the [dataset website]() for more details

## Important Dates

- **Competition launch with dataset and instructions release**: Sept. 15, 2025
- **Submission deadline**: Dec. 15, 2025
- **Results announced**: Mar. 15, 2026
<!-- - **Live competition and winners announced**: During OFC 2026 (Mar. 15â€“19) -->

## Prizes

- **Invited papers** from the ML Challenge winner to the **IEEE/Optica Journal of Lightwave Technology(JLT)**
- A **dedicated repository** for hosting all the ML Challenge results and the leaderboard
- Prizes (e.g., GPUs supported by Industry) support research for the future

## Materials

In **Phase 1** (prior to OFC), we invite ML Challenge submissions using the existing public COSMOS and OpenIreland [datasets](https://github.com/functions-lab/COSMOS-EDFA-Dataset). The submissions will be evaluated by a dedicated committee and student volunteers, who must declare any conflict of interest (COI) with competing teams, based on accuracy. 

<!-- - **Innovation**: Novel approaches and techniques used in developing the ML models;
- **Accuracy**: Average accuracy and tail accuracy of the developed ML models;
- **Efficiency**: Computational and training efficiency of the proposed solutions, and the amount of training data required to achieve the target accuracy performance. -->
