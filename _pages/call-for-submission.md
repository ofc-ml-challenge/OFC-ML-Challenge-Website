## Submission Guidelines

### 1. Format Requirements
- Submit your predictions in **CSV** format.
- Include columns for: `sample_id`, `predicted_gain_profile`.
- Ensure your file matches the expected output format as specified in the challenge documentation.

### 2. Submission Process
- Upload your prediction file through the official submission portal (link will be provided on the challenge website).
- Include a brief description of your methodology and approach.
- Provide source code and model documentation (optional but recommended).

### 3. Evaluation Criteria
- **Prediction accuracy** (primary metric)
- Computational efficiency
- Model interpretability
- Innovation in approach

### 4. Technical Requirements
- Maximum file size: 100MB
- Supported formats: CSV, JSON
- Include model inference time for efficiency evaluation

### 5. Important Dates
- **Competition launch with dataset and instructions release**: Sept. 15, 2025
- **Submission deadline**: Dec. 15, 2025
- **Finalists announced**: Jan. 15, 2026
- **Live competition and winners announced**: During OFC 2026 (Mar. 15–19)

## Prizes

- **Invited papers** from the ML Challenge winner(s) to the IEEE/Optica JLT or JOCN Special Issue on “The 1st OFC 2026 ML Challenge”
- A **dedicated repository** for hosting all the ML Challenge results and the leaderboard
- An **award ceremony** will be held for the ML Challenge winning teams, with recognition (e.g., plaques) and prizes (e.g., GPUs supported by IEEE/Optica or Industry)

## Materials

In **Phase 1** (prior to OFC), we invite ML Challenge submissions using the existing public COSMOS and OpenIreland datasets ([GitHub link]). The submissions will be evaluated by a dedicated committee and student volunteers, who must declare any conflict of interest (COI) with competing teams, based on the following criteria:

- **Innovation**: Novel approaches and techniques used in developing the ML models;
- **Accuracy**: Average accuracy and tail accuracy of the developed ML models;
- **Efficiency**: Computational and training efficiency of the proposed solutions, and the amount of training data required to achieve the target accuracy performance.
