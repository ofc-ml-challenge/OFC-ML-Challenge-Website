Welcome to the **OFC ML Challenge**!

This is an official Optica event and part of the **OFC (Optical Fiber Communication Conference)** series. The challenge brings together researchers, engineers, and data scientists to tackle real-world problems in optical communications through both theretical, analytical and machine learning model.

## 2025 Challenge: Commercial EDFA Gain Profile Prediction

This year's challenge focuses on training models to predict gain profiles for **Commercial Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs)**. EDFAs are critical components in optical communication systems, and accurate gain profile prediction is essential for optimizing network performance and reliability.

### Challenge Details

- **Objective**: Develop ML models that can accurately predict the gain profile of commercial EDFAs under various operating conditions
- **Dataset**: Real-world EDFA data from commercial systems
- **Evaluation**: Models will be scored based on prediction accuracy and computational efficiency
- **Prize**: The highest-scoring model will receive an invitation to demonstrate their solution at the **OFC'26 conference**

### Why This Matters

EDFA gain profile prediction is crucial for:
- Network planning and optimization
- Dynamic power management
- System reliability and performance monitoring
- Cost-effective network operations

## Important Dates

- **Competition launch with dataset and instructions release**: Sept. 15, 2025
- **Submission deadline**: Dec. 15, 2025
- **Finalists announced**: Jan. 15, 2026
- **Live competition and winners announced**: During OFC 2026 (Mar. 15â€“19)
